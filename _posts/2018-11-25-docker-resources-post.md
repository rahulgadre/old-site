So you want to get started with Docker. Good choice, but it's important to have right resources to get started with Docker. 
This post is about the resources that I would recommend based on my experience. 

- Docker 101 Series | DevCom --- Virginia Tech Video Series
- Docker Mastery Course on Udemy by Bret Fisher
- Play-with-docker -- an online tool that lets you get started with Docker without any installation.
- DockerCon videos
