So you want to get started with Docker. Good choice, but it's important to have right resources to get started with Docker. 
This post is about the resources that I would recommend based on my experience. 

- Docker 101 Series, DevCom --- Virginia Tech Video Series
- Docker Mastery Course on Udemy by Bret Fisher
- Play-with-docker -- an online tool that lets you get started with Docker without any installation.
- DockerCon videos
- Local meetup group

### Docker 101 Series

I highly recommend this Docker 101 series from Virginia Tech if you want to get a mile wide knowledge of Docker. It's a 4 part video series which covers the basics of Docker, contains demos, and quickly discusses some high level topics. This series good to get started. Here's the link to the webpage which contains all 4 parts of the series.
