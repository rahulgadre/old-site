I am a Senior Systems Engineer and currently work at Avaya. I am part of the ACP 100 and 4200 product design and development R&D team. I have been actively involved in designing, testing, and deployment of Avaya’s ACP products.
Prior to my new role, I used to manage Avaya’s Highlands Ranch data center. My expertise include data center administration, DevOps and automation, and cloud computing. I enjoy working on DevOps, cloud computing and Automation. I also recently earned my first AWS certification.

Prior to joining Avaya, I worked as a Network Engineering Intern at NRG Energy and Finger Lakes Technologies Group. My internship experiences helped me gain skills about customer support, network administration, hardware deployment, and system administration.

Before coming to the US, I worked as a System Administrator at HSBC Software India Pvt. Ltd where I worked on a security related project dealing with electronic communication surveillance.
I received a B.E in Electronics Engineering from University of Mumbai and a Masters in Networking and System Administration with a 4.0 GPA from Rochester Institute of Technology .
